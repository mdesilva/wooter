Don't touch css file, if want to develop css change from scss.

Recommend prepros for compile scss:
- Install Prepros from this address ... https://prepros.io/
- After install drag public folder from wooter root directory (woozard), to prepros app or click add project from app and choose public folder
- Now all are setup, minimize app and continue work, scss will auto compile on save file

So for more details contact me on skype (alin.designstudio), Thanks :)
