To ensure access to our secure server before submission of personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. Alternatively, look at the URL or location line of your browser and secure server access is reflected in the first characters of the address changing from “http” to “https.”
