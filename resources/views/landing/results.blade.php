			<p>Organizers are responsible for the well-being of participants, coaches, officials and spectators. Buying sports insurance is one way to ensure that in the event that accidents do happen there will be financial coverage for the victim and the organization.
			<br><br>
			This coverage is designed for U.S. based teams, leagues, clubs, associates, camps, clinics, lessons, tournaments and events conducting youth or adult amateur sports activities.
